- added Globals::lastLicenseVerificationTime to avoid to frequent xml loading ( for example when timeframe is changed frequently )

2.4.103

- replaced setEx4Name with setInfo
- added LGT_INFO logger type

- ping v0 implemented

2.4.109
- replaced account detection criteria 'server official name' to 'server ip:port'
- autolicense (still developing)
- ping v3 implemented(still developing)
mql:
- cpp init() return value is always checked now to avoid calling of setinfo() in case of auth failure and chart close. In this case something stucks in mt4

2.4.110 prerelease
TODO: 
1. VMP protect sendPing() - ultimate

- license ttl without RV reduced from 24h to 1h
- debug icon re-implemented

- license is reloaded on init if ttl passed

2.4.110
- had to revert to previous state, previous psu stated changes (since 7/18/2014) are lost on production server but they are still in [psu] server available. We need to implement the changes 1 by 1 slowly
